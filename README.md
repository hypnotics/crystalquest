### Day 0 - Design document & concept art
On the evening before going to bed I created a really basic [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KDXjX0KTG0FkrzLg51cF8HK-9QZGJt_8rKDtK9qtxGs/edit?usp=sharing)

Not to follow strict but as a generative start to my programming. Used ChatGPT for some concept art.

### Day 1 - Game mechanics
Downloaded cursor and started to type stuff in the Chat. Tried out mostly basic stuff, but managed to build almost complete game mechanic fundamentals.
- Generate world map with random Islands
- Generate character, stats and inventory
- Game menu with a few actions focused around outfitting 
- Some locic around Growing crop, exploring ruins, magic items
- Trading different goods

Most advanced was probably to introduce save state and colored ANSI for the terminal, but this also worked this one click.

Number of lines in game.py ~1000

- Sea travel onboard a ship as deckhand
- Nemesis added

Number of lines of code in game.py ~1250

### Day 3 - Travel and explore
